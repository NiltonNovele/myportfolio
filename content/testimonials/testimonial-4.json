  "feedback": "With the desire to create practical solutions—but without knowing much about coding—I threw myself into learning Full-Stack development using various frameworks. It was the most frustrating and overwhelming time in my journey, trying to learn everything fast enough to start building. But I pulled through. At university, I’d only learned C++, so I pushed myself to also learn Java, JavaScript, and their ecosystems to create real applications from scratch.",
