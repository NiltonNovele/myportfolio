  "feedback": "During my first year at university, I had a module on networking and security—and I instantly loved it. That experience led me to switch from Software Engineering to Networking and Security. Not long after, I discovered ethical hacking and was completely hooked. I dove in headfirst and haven’t looked back since. I even made Kali Linux my daily driver (though I don’t recommend it unless you know what you're doing).",
